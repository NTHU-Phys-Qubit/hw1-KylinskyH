Germany, as expected, is not a place that I expected to be.  First of all, I feel uncomfortable in many repect during the very first day. I, as a foreigner, has to tolerate others giving me weird looking. Gosh, I now realize why foreigners in Taiwan hate Taiwanese look at them. I hate it too!
The towns and the builldings are also not that beautiful as I thought before( Franfurt especially) However, not all thing were that bad. Today,in the train, there's a gorgeous german girl had the seat in front of me. Though we didn't talk to each other except for the courtesy( and nothing special), I still wanna to get acquainted with her. But just as before, I did nothing. She only left with a silent tchuss. Was she also interested with me? If not, why would she wanted to give me such an indifferent goodbye? Wasn't she just being angry about me not asking for her FB?( I hope so) By the first day I wanna to go back home!!
